Three functional classes of DNA methyltransferase exist in A.thaliana; METHYLTRANSFERASE1 (MET1) (orthologous to mammalian Dnmt1) which maintains CG methylation, CHROMOMETHYLASE3 (CMT3) (plant specific) which maintains methylation in non-CG sequence contexts and DOMAINS REARRANGED METHYLTRANSFERASE2 (DRM2) (orthologous to Dnmt3a/Dnmt3b) which both de novo methylates DNA and maintains non-CG methylation redundantly with CMT3 [2]. The drm2 mutation blocks all de novo DNA methylation driven by repeat containing transgenes [15]â€“[17].
