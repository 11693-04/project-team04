The regulatory role of protein kinase C (PKC) in glycogen metabolism in pectin fed rats was investigated. Administration of pectin (5 g/kg body wt/day) from cucumber (Cucumis sativius L.) led to inhibitory effects on PKC activity in the liver of rats. In the brain and pancreas, PKC activity was significantly higher in pectin-treated rats as compared to the control group. Level of blood glucose was significantly lowered and the level of glycogen in the liver was significantly increased in pectin-administered rats.
