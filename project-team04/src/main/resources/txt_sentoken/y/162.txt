However, in contrast to the core autophagy genes such as atg5 and atg7, expression of ulk1 is not essential for induction of macroautophagy in response to nutrient deprivation or for survival of newborn mice. Together, these data suggest that the ATG1 homologue, Ulk1, is a component of the selective autophagy machinery that leads to the elimination of organelles in erythroid cells rather that an essential mechanistic component of autophagy.
