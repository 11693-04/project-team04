In normal porcine myocardium T3 had no effect on the extent of isometric force generation but accelerated the time course of force development (p < 0.05) and increased the calcium transient (p < 0.001). After induction of myocardial depression by epinephrine exposure T3 accelerated the intracellular calcium transients and reduced diastolic calcium
