As expected, maternal plasma 25-[OH] D concentrations were inversely associated with maternal adiposity as estimated by pre-pregnancy BMI (ρ = −0.28, p = 0.04 in GDM cases; ρ = −0.25, P = 0.01 in controls).Maternal plasma 25-[OH] D concentrations were 20% lower, on average, among women who subsequently developed GDM, as compared with those who were not diagnosed with GDM (Figure 1).
