In this study we have used evolutionary constraint as an indicator of putative enhancers in the vertebrate Lhx2 locus. Due to selective pressure, noncoding functional elements such as enhancers tend to evolve slowly compared to their neighboring sequences and hence can be identified as conserved noncoding elements in comparisons of related genomes. This strategy has been effectively used to identify a large number of putative enhancers conserved in distantly related vertebrates such as mammals and teleost fishes [26], [27], [28], [29]. Functional assay of such elements in transgenic mouse and zebrafish have indeed indicated that a large number of them function as transcriptional enhancers directing tissue-specific expression of reporter genes during embryonic development [26], [28], [29]. We have aligned sequences of the Lhx2 locus from human, mouse and pufferfish (fugu) genomes and predicted conserved noncoding elements (CNEs) in the locus. Functional assay of these CNEs in a transgenic mouse assay system showed that half of them function as tissue-specific enhancers at embryonic day 11.5.
