Levels of several microRNA (miR-10a, -10b, -212, -132, -495) were significantly altered. One of them (miR-132) has been reported to be highly inducible by growth factors and to be a key regulator of neurite outgrowth. Moreover, miR-132-recognition sequences were detected in the mRNA transcripts of two differentially expressed proteins. MicroRNA may thus represent novel biomarkers for neuronal malfunction and potential therapeutic targets for human neurodegenerative diseases.
