Although in this study we focused on the antagonistic function of AIMP2-DX2 against the pro-apoptotic activity of AIMP2-F via p53 in response to DNA damage, it may also influence the normal activity of AIMP2 in these two other pathways with a similar mode of action, namely, through the competitive binding to the target proteins
