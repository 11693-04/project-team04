In addition to this nonselective or bulk autophagy, selective types of autophagy are used for biosynthetic transport (the cytoplasm-to-vacuole targeting [Cvt] pathway), and to recognize and degrade specific cargoes or organelles. These latter include the selective degradation of mitochondria (mitophagy), peroxisomes (pexophagy), and ribosomes (ribophagy; Reggiori et al., 2005; Kanki and Klionsky, 2008; Kraft et al., 2008; Geng et al., 2010). Among different kinds of selective autophagy, mitophagy is particularly crucial
