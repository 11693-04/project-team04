This randomised controlled trial compared the effect of equipotent anaesthetic doses of sevoflurane (S group) versus propofol (P group), during remifentanil-based anaesthesia for off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery, on myocardial injury. Either sevoflurane or propofol was titrated to maintain bispectral index values between 40 and 50.
