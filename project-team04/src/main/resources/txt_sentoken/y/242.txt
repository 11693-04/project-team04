Our study indicates a molecular mechanism by which the sensitivity of thyroid cancer cells is regulated by the level of GRP78 as well as preferential induction of GRP78 or CHOP upon treatment with proteasome inhibitors. Our experiments therefore suggest a novel approach toward sensitization of thyroid cancer cells to proteasome inhibitors.
