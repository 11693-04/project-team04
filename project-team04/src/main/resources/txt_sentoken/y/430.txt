Distribution of mutations of JAK2, EZH2, TET2, IDH1 or IDH2 genes in CMML patients are represented in Figure 1 and further detailed in Table S4. A total of 15 out of 24 patients (65%) showed TET2 gene mutations. In 4 patients, a JAK2V617F gene mutation was found while only 1 patient showed a mutation of EZH2.
