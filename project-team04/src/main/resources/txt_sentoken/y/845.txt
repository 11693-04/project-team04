Nimodipine is a dihydropyridine that blocks calcium influx through the L-type calcium channels. It is the most rigorously studied and only drug approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for use in treatment of vasospasm. It is safe [12,59], cost-effective [60], and most importantly reduces the risk of poor outcome and secondary ischemia after aneurysmal SAH [7,10-12,61].
