In this study, 2 fatty acids with strong Î±-glucosidase-inhibitory activity, 7(Z)-octadecenoic acid and 7(Z),10(Z)-octadecadienoic acid, were purified and identified from sea cucumber. Therefore, sea cucumber fatty acids can potentially be developed as a novel natural nutraceutical for the management of type-2 diabetes.
