Using computational methods we collected data from publicly available sources to find candidate STEPs in consensus regions of introns and in transcripts displaying alternative splicing around the candidate STEP. We further examined candidate STEPs in silico for splice site recognition using sequences containing each SNP allele and for expressed sequence tag (EST) evidence of intron retention where possible. Presented here are results of this search, along with 21 potential intron retaining or exon extending STEPs where allele population frequency and EST data has shown a disproportionate retention of one STEP allele, as well as a spliced form.
