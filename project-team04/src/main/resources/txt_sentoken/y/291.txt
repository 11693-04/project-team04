n silico comparison of drug potencies with microRNA expression profiles across the entire NCI-60 panel revealed that approximately 30 microRNAs, including mir-21, show highly significant correlations with numerous anticancer agents. Ten of those microRNAs have already been implicated in cancer biology. Our results support a substantial role for microRNAs in anticancer drug response, suggesting novel potential approaches to the improvement of chemotherapy.
