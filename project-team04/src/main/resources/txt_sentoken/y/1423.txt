Lastly, for merge and split events, a comparison of their counts revealed a 0.86:1 merge-to-split ratio, which at first seemed inconsistent with previous studies suggesting that fusion occurs more often than fission by a factor of 2.6â€“5.6 (Snel et al. 2000, Kummerfeld and Teichmann 2005, Fong et al. 2007). However, one key difference in this analysis is that we measured individual events, as opposed to simply observing the presence of fused and fragmented extant genes, and we measured events over a smaller higher resolution time scale (the 62 My Drosophila clade vs. all three domains of life diverging over 3.5 billion years).
