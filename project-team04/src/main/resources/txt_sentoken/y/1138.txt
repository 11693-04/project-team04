In both studies, there was no difference in postdischarge outcomes at Day 7. Sevoflurane/sevoflurane was more costly with higher PONV rates in both studies. In adults, the cost per extra episode of PONV avoided was pound 296 (propofol/propofol vs. propofol/ sevoflurane) and pound 333 (propofol/sevoflurane vs. propofol/isoflurane).
