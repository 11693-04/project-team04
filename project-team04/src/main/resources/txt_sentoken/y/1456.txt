Such pre-mRNA splicing may be tissue-specific and is equivalent between all individuals in a population, but some is individual-specific because the alleles of a polymorphism differentially affect splicing through their presence in or effect on splicing sequence motifs. For example, a branch point SNP, rs17266594 leads to the Δ2 isoform of BANK1 protein which lacks a putative IP3R-binding domain, altering B cell signalling and activity and SLE disease risk [4]. Similarly, SNP rs6897932 in a putative exonic splice enhancer in IL7R seems to affect exon 6 splicing, amounts of soluble versus membrane-bound IL7R and risks of multiple sclerosis [5] and type 1 diabetes [6].In a study of the human insulin gene (INS), we recognised in silico, subsequently confirmed in vitro and in silico [7], and later in vivo by others [8], [9], that polymorphism in a 5′ non-coding intron (separating non-coding exon 1 from coding exon 2) could influence intron retention in the final mRNA.
