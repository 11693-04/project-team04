the rate of adverse events (AE) did not differ with anastrozole compared to tamoxifen in the ATAC trial (68 months median follow-up: respectively 93.9% vs 94.6%, p = ns) while the rate of drug-related AE leading to withdrawal was lower for patients treated with anastrozole (6.5% vs 8.9%, p = 0.0005) (ATAC Trialistsâ€™ Group 2005).
