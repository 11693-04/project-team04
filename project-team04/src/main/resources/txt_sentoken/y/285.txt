Pharmacogenomics, toxicogenomics, and small RNA expression analysis are three of the most active research topics in the biological, biomedical, pharmaceutical, and toxicological fields. All of these studies are based on gene expression analysis, which requires reference genes to reduce the variations derived from different amounts of starting materials and different efficiencies of RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis.
