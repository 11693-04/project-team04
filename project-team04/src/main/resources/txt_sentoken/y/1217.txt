Using miRNA microarray analysis, Chang et al. identified seven miRNAs that were up-regulated (mir-21, let-7, 18, 29c, 142-3p, 155, and 146b) and one miRNA that was down-regulated (mir-494) in HNSCC primary tissue and cell lines. Moreover, they demonstrated that cytochrome c release was decreased by mir-21 knockdown, which suggested mir-21 inhibited several mRNAs that then led to a cascade of events that prevented apoptosis and increased cellular proliferation [35]
