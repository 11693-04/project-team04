A variety of methods for profiling FFPE tissue
have been employed
recently. Some are practical for slide-mounted FFPE tissue, such as
quantitative fluorescence imaging analysis (QFIA), which is reproducible
and sensitive for specific standardized proteins,12−14 or MALDI-imaging
mass spectrometry (MS).15−17 Other encouraging mass spectrometry
(MS)-based proteomic studies of FFPE tissues have appeared in the
recent literature;2−7,9,18−20 however, these investigations have typically been
restricted to minute tissue specimens, such as those obtained by laser
capture microdissection.
