We discovered that activation of the UPR in yeast also induces a new branch of macroautophagy that selectively targets the ER. We term this process "ER-phagy", in analogy to pexophagy and mitophagy, the two other known forms of organelle-specific marcoautophagy. ER-phagy involves the generation of autophagosomes that selectively include ER membranes and whose delimiting double membranes also derive, at least in part, from the ER.
