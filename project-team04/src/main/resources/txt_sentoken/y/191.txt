Macroautophagy may protect cells from apoptosis (Boya et al., 2005), probably by eliminating damaged mitochondria (Brunk and Terman, 2002), and is required for supranormal longevity in Caenorhabditis elegans (Melendez et al., 2003). Moreover, macroautophagy is involved in degrading mutated and aggregated proteins that are implicated in neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's (Cuervo et al., 2004) and Huntington's disease (Ravikumar et al., 2004).
