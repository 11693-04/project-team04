transcriptional enhancers in developing mouse embryos, found that the enhancers directed reporter expression most frequently in the brain and neural tube. More recently, a similar association between ultraconserved noncoding elements (noncoding sequences exceedingly conserved in human, chimp and mouse) and genes that preferentially express in the central nervous system has been described [51]. Using the GNF Human GeneAtlas, this study found that nine out of the ten tissues that express genes most significantly associated with ultraconserved noncoding elements constitute various members of the central nervous system.10.1371/journal.pone.0020088.g007Figure 7TF-encoding genes predominantly expressed in the central nervous system are enriched with CNEs.
