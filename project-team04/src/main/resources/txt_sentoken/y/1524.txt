There has been a good deal of attention in the use of FPGAs to address bottlenecks in computational biology pipelines. Examples include the use of FPGAs to improve the speed of homology search [18,19] for computing phylogenetic trees [20], for the pairwise alignment step in multiple sequence alignment using CLUSTALW [21], and for acceleration of the Smith-Waterman sequence alignment algorithm [18]
