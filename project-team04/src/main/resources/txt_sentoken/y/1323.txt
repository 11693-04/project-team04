In our report, we demonstrate that the Latimeria menadoensis shh locus contains all conserved proximal enhancers shared nonuniformly by fishes and land vertebrates. We provide experimental verification for enhancer activity of the putative Latimeria enhancers in transgenic zebrafish and electroporated chick embryos. From DNA sequence comparison of the shh locus of different vertebrate lineages, we infer that Latimeria conserved noncoding elements represent the ancestral gnathostome set of enhancers that diverged variably during vertebrate evolution.
