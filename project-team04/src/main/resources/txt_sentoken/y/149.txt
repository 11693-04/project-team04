In addition, the fact that MAP2 was co-localized with LC3, p62, and ubiquitin within clustered puncta suggests that the observed LC3-immunoreactive autophagosomes are localized to neuronal processes and that MAP2 undergoes turnover by means of the selective degradation of ubiquitinated proteins via macroautophagy
