Islets preincubated with glucose (3.3 mmol/l) and glucagon (1.4 mumol/l) plus theophylline (10 mmol/l), ACTH (0.11 nmol/l), bovine GH (0.46 mumol/l), prolactin (0.2 mumol/l) or tri-iodothyronine (1.0 nmol/l) have significantly lower Ca(2+)-ATPase activity than those preincubated with only 3.3 mmol glucose/l. All these hormones increased the release of insulin significantly.
