of using pairs of brain-enriched plasma microRNA (miRNA), at least one of which is enriched in synapses and neurites, as biomarkers that could differentiate patients with MCI from age-matched controls. The identified biomarker pairs fall into two sets: the "miR-132 family" (miR-128/miR-491-5p, miR-132/miR-491-5p and mir-874/miR-491-5p) and the "miR-134 family" (miR-134/miR-370, miR-323-3p/miR-370 and miR-382/miR-370).
