Altogether 12 previously reported changes and four novel genetic alterations, mostly in intronic sequences, were identified. The results revealed the presence of biallelic germline MYH mutations in two patients. These patients were compound heterozygotes for two of the most common germline mutations c.494 A>G (p.Y165C); c.1,145 G>A (p.G382D). These variants are established to be associated with adenomatous polyposis and colorectal cancer.
