There were no differences in gene-level expression of the candidate genes between strains that reached genome-wide significance. When we investigated exon-level expression of the genes, there were no differences between parental strains. However, exon 4 of ZEB1 had much lower expression compared to all other exons of this gene, indicating alternative splicing (Figure 6A). Interestingly, ZEB1 produces two splice variants, Zfhep1 (NP_037296.1, ENSRNOT00000046013) and Zfhep2 (ZEB1, ENSRNOT00000024336), for which exon 4 (NP_037296.1 exon 1) is specific for the Zfhep1 variant (Figure 6B). The resulting protein differs in the first zinc finger cluster (Figure 6C). This prompted us to investigate if splice-variant specific differences of ZEB1 could be involved in regulation of EAE
