. Comparison of microRNA expression patterns and compound potency patterns showed significant correlations, suggesting that microRNAs may play a role in chemoresistance. Combined with gene expression and other biological data using multivariate analysis, microRNA expression profiles may provide a critical link for understanding mechanisms involved in chemosensitivity and chemoresistance.
