In order to study the role of DNA damage processing in the development of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), we assessed the ability of six keratinocyte cell lines from a multistage-tumor progression model to repair three types of DNA damage: pyrimidine dimers, oxidative DNA lesions and DNA double strand breaks (DSB).
