It has been demonstrated that DNMT1 accounts for the majority of de novo methyltransferase activity in protein extracts from human colon cancer cells [86]. Taking into account the low intrinsic de novo methyltransferase ability of DNMT1 cases [6, 77], this protein may also be capable of initiating aberrant CpG island methylation patterns, replacing the conventional de novo DNMT3s, at least in cancer cells.
