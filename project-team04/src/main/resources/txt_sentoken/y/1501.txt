e previously suggested that the majority of the TE-derived exons are non-symmetrical because they are still young in evolutionary terms and thus have not yet undergone purifying selection, which eliminates deleterious exonizations. Given a sufficient period of time, some of the currently non-symmetrical exons that are only mildly deleterious will eventually become symmetrical (through small deletions/insertions) and thus will add coding capacity into already established genes. Examples of functional TE-exonizations are exon 8 of ADAR2 gene [60] and exon 8 of NARF gene [47].
