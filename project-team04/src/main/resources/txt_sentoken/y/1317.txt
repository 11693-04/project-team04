Out of the four CNEs that showed expression in the central nervous system and the dorsal root ganglia, three showed overlapping expression in the hindbrain and all showed similar expression in the neural tube. These overlapping expression patterns of the different enhancers suggest that they are either associated with different genes in this locus or alternatively, redundant enhancers of the same gene.
