In a 4T1 metastatic breast carcinoma model, AN-7 inhibited the formation of lung lesions by 76% and AN-9 by 47%, further demonstrating the greater efficacy of AN-7 compared to AN-9 (P<0.02). Both AN-7 and AN-9 exhibited antimetastatic and antiangiogenic activities by reducing vascularization, bFGF expression and HIF-1alpha.
