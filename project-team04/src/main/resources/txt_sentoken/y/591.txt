Basing on our experience with 39 patients with severe urge incontinence (in one-quarter of the cases pure urge incontinence, in one-half of the cases mixed incontinence and in a further quarter of the cases neurogenic bladder disorders) a supervised programme (mictiogram) and a well-tried therapy (especially in the Anglo-Saxon countries) consisting of the triad hospitalisation/bladder training/medication therapy are presented. After an average hospitalisation period of 14 days, we were able to achieve a symptom-free state in 94% of the patients.
