An expression abundance analysis, based on a signal density â‰¥20,000, showed that both normal and cancerous cervical tissues had abundant expression of miR-23a, miR-23b, let-7a, let-7c, and let-7d, whereas high expression of miR-26a, miR-29a, miR-99a, miR-100, miR-125b, miR-143, miR-145, miR195, and miR-199a was only observed in normal cervical tissues, and high expression of miR-16, miR-21, miR-205, and let-7f was only observed in cervical cancer tissues, despite that relatively low levels of miR-16 and miR-21 were noticed from a homogeneous cell population in some cell lines (Fig. 2B).
