The following results were obtained: In class I HLA typing, the frequency of HLA-Bw35 in SAT was 67.4%, which was significantly (p less than 0.0001) higher than that in the control (14.1%). On the other hand, the frequency of Cw1 in SAT (14.6%) was significantly (p less than 0.01) lower than that of the control (32.1%), and that of Cw3 (65.2%) was significantly (p less than 0.01) higher than that of the control (46.5%).
