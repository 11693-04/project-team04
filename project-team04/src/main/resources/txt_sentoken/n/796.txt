we identified decreased FHIT expression resulting in apoptosis inhibition and decreasing apoptosis associated with abnormal levels of some pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins (Bax, Bcl-2 and Survivin) by TUNEL and TMA. Our results demonstrated that the mutation in the FHIT gene significantly reduced FHIT expression in human CRC. Both TUNEL and TMA experiments demonstrated significantly inhibited apoptosis by down-regulation of Bax and up-regulation of Survivin and Bcl-2. Collectively, these studies identify the mechanism by which an important tumor suppressor gene, FHIT, inactivated specifically in human CRC, and contributes to our understanding of the mechanism of colorectal carcinogenesis.
