Survivin, an anti-apoptotic protein encoded by BIRC5, to perform immunostaining on a melanoma progression tissue microarray (TMA). This TMA contained 480 cores of tumor tissues representing benign nevi, thin and thick primary cutaneous melanoma, as well as lymph node and visceral melanoma metastasis. As shown in Figure 3C, Survivin expression was low to absent in the majority of the benign nevi but was significantly elevated in all melanomas (p<0.0001, Ï‡2).
