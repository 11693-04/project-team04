AZD1152-hQPA induced caspase-dependent apoptosis of some cell lines, demonstrated by loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, activation of caspase-9, followed by activation of caspase-3. This effect was accompanied by the inhibition of survivin expression. In vivo efficacy was determined in NOD/SCID/Î³c(null) mice implanted with the Ramos human BL cell line. AZD1152 had anti-tumour effects in this murine xenograft model. There preclinical data suggest that the inhibition of Aurora B kinase is a potentially useful therapeutic strategy in BL and HL.
