Aggressive (Group 2) melanomas were characterized by upregulation of genes associated with cell cycle progression, DNA replication and repair, and altered expression of apoptosis-related genes including upregulation of the antiapoptotic gene BIRC5/survivin [49] and downregulation of the novel stress-associated apoptosis inducer TRIB3 [50] (Table 1).
