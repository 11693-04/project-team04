The search for a specific inhibitor of the BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase have resulted in the identification of the specific inhibitor imatinib mesylate (STI571), which has now become the standard first-line therapy in patients with CP-CML [10,11]. Imatinib, also known as GleevecÂ® (Novartis, Basel, Switzerland), is a selective inhibitor not only of ABL but also for Kit and PDGFR kinases and exerts significant antileukemic activity in the majority of CML patients.
