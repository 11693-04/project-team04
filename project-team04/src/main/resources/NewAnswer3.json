        "o": "Isotretinoin is a medication used for the treatment of severe acne. It is sometimes used in prevention of certain skin cancers. It is a retinoid, meaning it derives from vitamin A and is found in small quantities naturally in the body. Isotretinoin binds to and activates nuclear retinoic acid receptors (RAR), thereby regulating cell proliferation and differentiation. This agent also exhibits immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory responses and inhibits ornithine decarboxylase, thereby decreasing polyamine synthesis and keratinization."

Due to selective pressure, noncoding functional elements such as enhancers tend to evolve slowly compared to their neighboring sequences and hence can be identified as conserved noncoding elements in comparisons of related genomes. This strategy has been effectively used to identify a large number of putative enhancers conserved in distantly related vertebrates such as mammals and teleost fishes [26], [27], [28], [29]. Functional assay of such elements in transgenic mouse and zebrafish have indeed indicated that a large number of them function as transcriptional enhancers directing tissue-specific expression of reporter genes during embryonic development [26], [28], [29]. We have aligned sequences of the Lhx2 locus from human, mouse and pufferfish (fugu) genomes and predicted conserved noncoding elements (CNEs) in the locus. Functional assay of these CNEs in a transgenic mouse assay system showed that half of them function as tissue-specific enhancers at embryonic day 11.5.",

The miR-29 family targets a cadre of mRNAs that encode proteins involved in fibrosis, including multiple collagens, fibrillins, and elastin. Thus, down-regulation of miR-29 would be predicted to derepress the expression of these mRNAs and enhance the fibrotic response. Indeed, down-regulation of miR-29 with anti-miRs in vitro and in vivo induces the expression of collagens, whereas over-expression of miR-29 in fibroblasts reduces collagen expression. We conclude that miR-29 acts as a regulator of cardiac fibrosis and represents a potential therapeutic target for tissue fibrosis in general.",
